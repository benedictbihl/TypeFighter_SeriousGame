# TypeFighter

TypeFighter is a serious game developed by students of the Julius-Maximilian-University of WÃ¼rzburg as a part of the module  
'software interface design'. 

Goal of this module was to:
- Get a glimpse of what it is like to work as a Team on a bigger project using tools commonly found in software development like git or slack.
- Get introduced to various technologies including the Play! Framework, MySQL, JavaFX, HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
- Connect these technologies to a working Web Application with database communication.


The game itself, which is done entirely in JS using the Phaser Engine, aims to improve the players typing skills by letting them 
type different texts while providing visual and acoustic feedback as well as a score and error rate. Around the game exist different webpages
like a login page, a profile page, a friendslist and messaging system and of course a setup menu, containing the level selection and high scores.
